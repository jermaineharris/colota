# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: August 19, 2026**

Colota ("the App") is a self-hosted GPS tracking application for Android, developed by Max Dietrich. This privacy policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that data.

## Data Collection

### Location Data

The App collects the following location-related data when tracking is active:

- GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)
- Altitude
- Speed
- Bearing (direction)
- Accuracy
- Timestamp

### Device Data

The App also collects:

- Battery level (0-100%)
- Battery status (charging, unplugged, full)

### Geofence Data

If you create pause zones (geofences), the App stores zone names, coordinates, radii and per-zone settings (enabled state, tracking pause, WiFi pause, motionless pause, motionless timeout, heartbeat enabled, heartbeat interval and entry/exit notifications) in the local database.

### Condition Monitoring

When tracking profiles are enabled, the App monitors charging state, car mode (Android Auto) and GPS speed derived from location updates to automatically switch tracking configurations. These condition states are transient and are not stored in the database. The name of the currently active pause zone is persisted across service restarts to maintain continuity but is cleared when the zone is exited.

### Sensor Data

When motionless pause is enabled for a geofence zone or a stationary tracking profile is active, the App reads the device's accelerometer (in low-power batched mode) and significant motion sensor to detect motion. Raw sensor values are processed in real time on-device and are never stored or transmitted.

### Network State

When WiFi pause is enabled for a geofence zone, the App monitors whether the device is connected to an unmetered network (WiFi or Ethernet). Only the connection type is checked - no network names, SSIDs or IP addresses are collected or stored.

All data is stored **locally on your device** and is never sent anywhere unless you configure a server. The App does not collect personal identifiers, advertising IDs, device identifiers (IMEI, serial number), usage analytics, telemetry, or crash reports.

## Data Storage

Collected data is stored in a local SQLite database on your device. The data is not accessible to other apps. The App checks available device storage before downloading offline map packs.

If you configure auto-export, the App will write export files (CSV, GeoJSON, GPX, or KML) to a directory you select on your device. If you pick a cloud-synced folder, those files leave your device through that provider.

To enforce the file-retention limit you configure, the App also deletes export files from that directory. It only ever deletes files whose names match its own export naming pattern; other files and subfolders in the directory are left untouched.

The export file name is configurable and may include a `{device}` placeholder, which inserts your device model (for example `Pixel7`). If you use it and the directory is cloud-synced, your device model is visible to that provider and to anyone with access to the folder. It is not included unless you add the placeholder.

If you enable persistent file logging in Logging -> File, the App writes diagnostic log entries (which may include location coordinates and other sensitive information) to a private file in app storage. The file is removed when the App is uninstalled. Logs are never sent automatically; sharing them requires explicit user action via the "Export log file..." flow.

Authentication credentials (if configured) are encrypted.

### Importing Data

You can import location history from external files (GeoJSON, Google Timeline, GPX, KML, CSV) into the local database. The file is read from a location you select via the Android document picker; nothing leaves your device during import. If you opt in to "Import + Queue for Sync", imported rows are enqueued for replication to your sync backend like any other location data.

### Client Certificates and Trusted CAs

If you configure mTLS, the client certificate's private key is stored in the Android OS KeyStore. The PKCS12 password is used once during import and discarded. If you pick a certificate from Android's device certificate list instead, only a reference is stored; the key never enters the app process.

The Trusted Server CA (for self-signed or private-CA servers) is the server's public certificate only and contains no private key.

### Encrypted Backups

You can create a password-encrypted backup containing your location history, geofences, settings and authentication credentials. The password is never stored; if you lose it, the backup cannot be recovered, and a weak password weakens the protection.

Backups are written to a destination you choose via the Android file picker. If you pick a cloud-synced folder, the encrypted file leaves your device through that provider.

Restoring a backup overwrites the current database and credentials.

The App supports configuration via `huttstracking://setup` deep links. These links can include server endpoints and authentication credentials. You must explicitly confirm before any configuration is applied. Only open setup links from sources you trust.

You can also generate a setup link to share your own configuration (Settings -> Share Setup). Credentials are excluded by default; if you choose to include them they appear in the link in plain text, so only share it over a trusted channel.

## Data Transmission

The App **only transmits data to a server endpoint that you configure**. No data is sent anywhere by default.

- Data is sent via HTTPS (HTTP is only allowed for local/private network addresses). Self-signed or private-CA TLS certificates are supported by importing the CA in the in-app mTLS Settings (Trusted Server CA). Trust is scoped to Hutts Tracking only
- The **Test Connection** button sends a request to your configured endpoint to verify it works. These requests go only to your own server
- No analytics, tracking pixels, or advertising networks are used
- No data is shared with the developer, advertisers or analytics providers

## Data Sharing

Colota does not share your data with anyone. The only data transmission occurs to your own self-hosted server, if you choose to configure one.

## Third-Party Services

### Google Play

The GMS variant of the App is distributed via Google Play, which may collect data according to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). This is outside the App's control. The FOSS variant is available on F-Droid, IzzyOnDroid and GitHub Releases with no Google dependency.

### Map Tiles (maps.mxd.codes)

The App displays maps using a self-hosted tile server at [maps.mxd.codes](https://maps.mxd.codes), operated by the developer on a VPS provided by [netcup](https://www.netcup.de). No CDN, proxy or other external service (e.g. Cloudflare) sits in front of the server. When the map is visible or offline map packs are downloaded, your device makes requests to this server to fetch vector tiles. Downloaded tiles are cached in the app's local database for offline use. Requests identify the App by name and version (for example `Colota/1.14.0`) so that app traffic can be told apart from unknown bulk callers when logging is switched on. No device, install or user identifier is sent, and the value is the same for every install of a given version. Access logging is disabled for all requests by default. Logging may be enabled temporarily to investigate abuse or operational issues. No cookies or tracking are used. A custom tile server URL can be configured in Settings and receives the same requests. See the [tile server guide](/docs/guides/tile-server) for more details.

### No Other Third Parties

The App contains no third-party SDKs, analytics tools, advertising frameworks, or cloud services.

## Data Retention

Location data remains on your device until you delete it. You can:

- Export data in CSV, GeoJSON, GPX, or KML format
- Delete sent history
- Delete data older than a specified number of days
- Clear all data from the database

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control:

- **Access**: View all data in the app's Data Management screen
- **Export**: Export your data at any time in multiple formats
- **Delete**: Delete any or all data at any time
- **Portability**: Export your data freely, including as a full encrypted backup for device-to-device transfer
- **Import**: Bring location history from other apps or backups via file import (GeoJSON, Google Timeline, GPX, KML, CSV)
