# Installation

## From Google Play

[Get it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.huttsmedia.huttstracking&hl=en-US)

The Google Play version uses Google Play Services for location (FusedLocationProvider).

## From F-Droid

[Get it on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.huttsmedia.huttstracking/)

The F-Droid version uses Android's native LocationManager - the platform's fused location provider on Android 12+ (an AOSP API, not Google Play Services), falling back to raw GPS on older versions - and has **no Google Play Services dependency**. This is the recommended option for devices running LineageOS, CalyxOS, or any ROM without Google services.

## From IzzyOnDroid

[Get it on IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/packages/com.huttsmedia.huttstracking/)

The IzzyOnDroid version is the same FOSS variant as on F-Droid and has **no Google Play Services dependency**. IzzyOnDroid typically receives new releases faster than the official F-Droid repository.

**GrapheneOS users:** You can use the Google Play variant with sandboxed Google Play, or install the FOSS variant via F-Droid, IzzyOnDroid or GitHub Releases. GrapheneOS reroutes location requests to its own reimplementation of the Play geolocation service, so you get the accuracy benefits of FusedLocationProvider without sending location data to Google.

## From GitHub Releases

1. Download the latest APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dietrichmax/colota/releases)
   - **app-gms-release.apk** - Google Play Services variant
   - **app-foss-release.apk** - FOSS variant (no Google Play Services)
2. Enable **Install from Unknown Sources** in Android settings
3. Install the APK

## Build from Source

See [Build from Source](/docs/getting-started/build-from-source) for instructions on building both variants locally.
