# Troubleshooting

## App doesn't track in background

- Go to **Settings > Apps > Hutts Tracking > Battery** and select **Unrestricted**
- Verify location permissions are set to **Allow all the time**
- Grant notification permission if you want to see tracking status
- If the notification disappeared while the app still shows tracking on, Android killed the service. Opening the app restarts it. With battery set to **Unrestricted** it also restarts on its own, usually within 15 to 30 minutes

## Tracking doesn't start after reboot

- Make sure tracking was active before the reboot
- Do not force-stop Hutts Tracking. A force-stopped app receives no boot broadcast until you open it again
- **Samsung**: turn off "Pause app activity if unused" for Hutts Tracking (**Settings > Apps > Hutts Tracking > Battery**)
- **Xiaomi, Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus**: allow Autostart for Hutts Tracking in the phone's own security or battery app
- Disable battery optimization for Hutts Tracking (**Settings > Apps > Hutts Tracking > Battery > Unrestricted**)
- Open the app once if you have not used it for months. Android resets permissions for unused apps

## Tracking stopped on low battery and didn't resume

Colota stops tracking below 5% (when unplugged) and resumes automatically once you connect a charger. If it doesn't:

- **Only battery stops auto-resume, not manual stops** - if you stopped tracking yourself, start it again from the app
- **Don't force-stop the app** - that cancels the scheduled resume; it recovers on the next launch or reboot
- **Set the battery to Unrestricted** (**Settings > Apps > Hutts Tracking > Battery**) so the OS doesn't delay the charge-triggered resume.
- **A non-charging cable** (data-only, or an already-full battery) may not trigger it; a reboot while plugged in will

## GPS accuracy is poor

- Wait for GPS lock (can take 30-60 seconds)
- Move to an open area away from buildings
- Check if **High Accuracy** is enabled in device location settings
- Enable **Filter Inaccurate Locations** in app settings

## Trips are split or merged in the wrong place

Colota starts a new trip after a 15-minute gap in fixes, so a long stop can break one journey into several and two back-to-back activities can end up as one trip. Correct either case by hand from the Trips tab - see [Editing Trips](editing-trips.md).

## Server sync not working

1. Check endpoint URL format - must be `https://` for public endpoints, or `http://` for private/local addresses
2. Use the **Test Connection** button in settings
3. Check server logs for incoming requests
4. Verify network connectivity
5. Check the queue count in **Data Management**

**Common causes**: Wrong URL, HTTPS required for public endpoints, expired SSL certificate, incorrect authentication, mismatched field mapping, self-signed / private-CA server cert (see the [mTLS guide](/docs/configuration/mtls) for trust setup), **Sync Condition** restricting uploads to a specific network (Wi-Fi, SSID or VPN), missing local network permission on Android 16+.

### Test Connection error messages

If **Test Connection** fails, the message points at the specific layer that broke:

| Message | What it means | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Server certificate is not trusted (self-signed or unknown CA)` | TLS layer: Hutts Tracking can't validate the server's certificate chain | Import your CA via mTLS Settings -> Trusted Server CA, or use a publicly-trusted cert. User-installed CAs from Android Settings are not honored. |
| `Server requires a client certificate (mTLS) but none is configured` | TLS layer: the server demanded mTLS, Hutts Tracking didn't present one | Import a `.p12` in mTLS Settings -> Client Certificate |
| `Server rejected the client certificate` | TLS layer: cert was sent but rejected (wrong CA, expired, revoked) | Verify the cert matches what your reverse proxy expects |
| `Incorrect password for client certificate` | Import-time: the password doesn't unlock the `.p12` | Re-import with the correct password |
| `Hostname not verified` | TLS layer: server cert doesn't list the hostname/IP you connected to | Reissue the server cert with a SAN that includes your hostname/IP |
| `Server returned <code>: ...` | HTTP layer: TLS succeeded, but the server returned a 4xx/5xx | Check your auth headers, field mapping, and server logs |
| `Connection timed out` | Network layer: the server didn't respond in time | Check connectivity, firewall, server availability |
| `Local network access denied` | Permission: Android 16+ blocked the connection to a private IP | Grant Local Network Access (Settings -> Apps -> Hutts Tracking -> Permissions) |

## Viewing and exporting logs

**Settings > Logging** shows app log entries in two tabs.

### Live tab

This is the easiest way to view and share recent logs.

1. Open **Settings > Logging** (the Live tab opens by default)
2. Scroll through recent entries - the chips at the top filter by severity (`DEBUG` / `INFO` / `WARN` / `ERROR`)
3. Tap the share icon (top right) to save a text file containing the recent entries plus your app version and device info

### File tab

For bugs that take a while to happen:

1. Open **Settings > Logging** and switch to the **File** tab
2. Turn on **Persistent file logging**
3. Use the app until the problem happens again
4. Come back to the **File** tab and tap **Export log file...** - pick where to save it
5. Open a bug report at [github.com/dietrichmax/colota/issues](https://github.com/dietrichmax/colota/issues/new) and attach the saved `colota-log-*.txt`

**Heads up:** log files can contain your location coordinates. Please check the content of the file before sharing it.

The file grows the whole time logging is on. Tap **Clear log files** on the **File** tab to reset it.

## Debugging with adb logcat

Filter logs to see what Hutts Tracking is doing:

```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "LocationDB|NetworkManager|SyncManager|LocationService|GeofenceHelper"
```

Key log tags:

| Tag                | What it shows                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `LocationService`  | GPS fixes, service lifecycle       |
| `SyncManager`      | Queue processing, retry attempts   |
| `NetworkManager`   | HTTP requests, endpoint validation |
| `LocationDB`       | Database operations                |
| `GeofenceHelper`   | Zone detection                     |
| `AutoExportWorker` | Scheduled export execution         |

You can also use the **Location History** screen in the app to see recorded locations on a track map or as a list with their accuracy and timestamps.

## Local server not reachable (Android 16+)

Starting with Android 17, connecting to local/private network addresses requires the **Local Network Access** permission. Hutts Tracking requests this automatically when you test a local endpoint.

On some Android 16 devices, this may already be enforced via security patches using the **Nearby Wi-Fi Devices** permission instead.

If sync to a local server stopped working after an Android update:

1. Go to **Android Settings > Apps > Hutts Tracking > Permissions**
2. On Android 17+: Grant the **Local network access** permission
3. On Android 16: Grant the **Nearby devices** permission
4. Use the **Test Connection** button to verify

If you denied the permission and the system no longer shows the dialog, reset it from Android Settings.

## Locations not syncing on certain networks

If **Sync Only On** is set to Wi-Fi, a specific SSID or VPN, uploads are skipped when the condition is not met. Locations continue to be recorded and queued locally - they sync automatically when the condition is satisfied.

To change: **Settings > Advanced Settings > Network Settings > Sync Only On**.

## Auto-export not working

- Verify a directory is selected in **Settings > Auto-Export**
- Check that the toggle is enabled
- The first export fires at the configured time, not on enable. Tap **Export Now** to confirm the pipeline works without waiting
- Doze mode can delay an alarm by up to ~15 minutes - if exports are running but a few minutes late, that's expected
- If you see a "Directory permission lost" notification, re-select the export directory
- Check that the selected directory still exists and is accessible
- Transient errors (I/O failures) retry up to 3 times automatically; permanent errors (invalid config, directory issues) fail immediately without retrying
- If old exports seem to disappear, check the **File Retention** setting - by default only the last 10 files are kept
- Check the `HuttsTracking.AutoExportAlarm`, `HuttsTracking.AutoExportScheduler` and `HuttsTracking.AutoExportWorker` log tags in native logs for details

## Database growing too large

- Use **Clear Sent History** to remove synced locations
- Use **Delete Older Than X Days** for cleanup
- Export data first if you want to keep it
- Use **Vacuum Database** to reclaim space after deletions

**Size reference**: ~200 bytes per location, ~2 MB per 10,000 locations.
