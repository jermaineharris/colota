# Battery Optimization

Settings and tips to reduce battery usage without losing GPS fixes.

## Built-in Optimizations

- **Stationary detection**: When the device is still, [tracking profiles](/docs/guides/tracking-profiles) drop to a low-frequency heartbeat and [geofence motionless detection](/docs/guides/geofencing) stops GPS entirely; both resume on motion via the hardware sensor
- **Notification throttling**: Max 1 update per 10 seconds, plus 2-meter movement filter
- **Batch processing**: 50 items per batch, 10 concurrent network requests
- **Smart sync**: Only syncs when queue has items and network is available
- **Battery critical shutdown & auto-resume**: Stops tracking below 5% when unplugged (the dashboard shows "Tracking Stopped" and a notification appears), then automatically resumes once you connect a charger - or on the next reboot if already plugged in. A stop you triggered yourself is never auto-resumed

## Tips

1. **Increase GPS interval** - 5s to 30s saves significant battery
2. **Enable accuracy filtering** - Reject poor GPS fixes to avoid unnecessary processing
3. **Use batch sync** instead of instant - Reduces network usage and wake-ups
4. **Create geofences** for home/work - Stops recording locations in known zones. Enable **Pause when on WiFi** to also stop GPS entirely when connected to your home network, or **Pause when motionless** to stop GPS after sitting still for a set time
5. **Enable movement threshold** - 10-50m, skip stationary updates
6. **Disable battery optimization** for Hutts Tracking in Android settings to prevent the OS from killing the service

## Android Battery Settings

For reliable background tracking, configure Android to not restrict Colota:

1. Go to **Android Settings > Apps > Hutts Tracking > Battery**
2. Select **Unrestricted**
3. This prevents Android from killing the foreground service
