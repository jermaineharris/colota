# Deep Link Setup

Configure Hutts Tracking instantly using a `huttstracking://setup` URL. Generate a link or QR code with your server settings and share it with users - no manual typing required.

## Link Generator

Fill in the settings you want to configure. Only the fields you set will be included - everything else keeps its current value on the device. All processing happens in your browser - no data is sent to any server.

<DeepLinkGenerator />

## Sharing From the App

You can also generate a setup link straight from an existing installation, without the browser generator. Open **Settings -> Share Setup**, tick which categories to include - Tracking, Sync, API, Geofences, Profiles and Credentials - and tap **Share** to send the `huttstracking://setup` link through any app.

Credentials are off by default. Enabling them puts your username, password, bearer token or custom headers into the link in plain text, so only share it over a trusted channel.

Geofences and tracking profiles can also be shared on their own from the [Geofences](geofencing.md#sharing-zones) and Tracking Profiles screens.

## How It Works

1. User taps the link or scans a QR code
2. Hutts Tracking opens and shows a confirmation screen listing all settings that will be applied
3. Sensitive values (passwords, tokens) are masked in the preview
4. User taps **Apply Configuration** to save or **Cancel** to discard
5. Settings are persisted and the app navigates to the Dashboard

## URL Format

```
huttstracking://setup?config=BASE64_ENCODED_JSON
```

The `config` parameter is a base64-encoded JSON object. Only include the settings you want to change - everything else keeps its current value.

### Geofences

Each entry in the `geofences` array describes one pause zone. `name`, `lat`, `lon` and `radius` are required. Other fields fall back to safe defaults.

| Field                      | Type    | Default    | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`                     | string  | (required) | Display name                                                 |
| `lat`                      | number  | (required) | Latitude in decimal degrees                                  |
| `lon`                      | number  | (required) | Longitude in decimal degrees                                 |
| `radius`                   | number  | (required) | Radius in meters, must be > 0                                |
| `enabled`                  | boolean | `true`     | Zone is active on import                                     |
| `pauseTracking`            | boolean | `false`    | Stop saving locations inside the zone                        |
| `pauseOnWifi`              | boolean | `false`    | Also stop GPS while connected to Wi-Fi or Ethernet           |
| `pauseOnMotionless`        | boolean | `false`    | Also stop GPS after no motion for `motionlessTimeoutMinutes` |
| `motionlessTimeoutMinutes` | number  | `10`       | Minutes of stillness before motionless pause kicks in        |
| `heartbeatEnabled`         | boolean | `false`    | Record a point at the zone center while paused               |
| `heartbeatIntervalMinutes` | number  | `15`       | Heartbeat interval in minutes                                |

Imported geofences are appended by default. The import confirmation screen has a "Replace zones with the same name" toggle that deletes existing zones whose names match before creating the incoming ones.

You can build links with geofences using the in-browser generator above, the Node.js or Python snippets below, or by sharing zones directly from the Geofences screen in the app (see the [Geofencing](geofencing.md#sharing-zones) guide).

### Tracking Profiles

Each entry in the `profiles` array describes one [tracking profile](tracking-profiles.md). `name`, `interval`, `distance`, `syncInterval` and `condition` are required. Other fields fall back to safe defaults. `id` and `createdAt` are ignored on import - the receiving device always creates fresh rows.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | (required) | Display name |
| `interval` | number | (required) | GPS interval in seconds (must be >= 1) |
| `distance` | number | (required) | Movement threshold in meters |
| `syncInterval` | number | (required) | Sync interval in seconds (0 = instant) |
| `condition.type` | string | (required) | `charging`, `android_auto`, `speed_above`, `speed_below`, or `stationary` |
| `condition.speedThreshold` | number | - | Required for `speed_above` / `speed_below`. Speed in m/s (divide km/h by 3.6) |
| `priority` | number | `10` | Higher value wins when multiple profiles match |
| `activationDelay` | number | `0` (stationary: `60`) | Seconds the condition must keep matching before the profile is applied (0 = immediate). For `stationary`, how long the device must be still before activating |
| `deactivationDelay` | number | `60` (stationary: `0`) | Seconds to keep the profile active after the condition stops matching. Stationary resumes instantly via the motion sensor |
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Profile is active on import |

Imported profiles are appended by default. When both profiles and geofences are present the same "Replace ... with the same name" toggle on the import screen also deletes existing profiles whose names match before creating the incoming ones.

You can build links with profiles using the in-browser generator above, the Node.js or Python snippets below, or by sharing profiles directly from the Tracking Profiles screen in the app.

## Generating Links Programmatically

### Using Node.js

```bash
node -e "
const config = {
  endpoint: 'https://my-server.com/api/locations',
  interval: 10,
  apiTemplate: 'owntracks',
  auth: { type: 'bearer', bearerToken: 'my-token' },
  geofences: [
    { name: 'Home', lat: 52.52, lon: 13.405, radius: 100, pauseTracking: true }
  ]
};
const encoded = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(config)).toString('base64');
console.log('huttstracking://setup?config=' + encoded);
"
```

### Using Python

```bash
python3 -c "
import json, base64
config = {'endpoint': 'https://my-server.com/api/locations', 'interval': 10}
encoded = base64.b64encode(json.dumps(config).encode()).decode()
print(f'huttstracking://setup?config={encoded}')
"
```

## Security Notes

- The configuration URL is not encrypted. Avoid putting sensitive tokens in QR codes displayed in public.
- All settings are shown to the user for confirmation before being applied.
