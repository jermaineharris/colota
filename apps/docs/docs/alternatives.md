## When to use each

**Hutts Tracking** is a good fit if you want a self-hosted tracking app with location history, geofencing, and backend flexibility - and you want to see and manage your data inside the app itself.

**[OwnTracks](https://owntracks.org)** is a better fit if you need MQTT support. It has both Android and iOS clients, making it the natural choice for mixed-platform households.

**[GPSLogger](https://gpslogger.app)** is a better fit if your goal is a GPX, KML, or CSV file rather than a live server sync - for hiking, geotagging photos, or recording routes. It can also upload directly to Dropbox, Google Drive, FTP, and OpenStreetMap.

**[Traccar Client](https://www.traccar.org/client/)** is a better fit if you exclusively use Traccar and want the simplest possible client with no extra features.

**[μLogger](https://github.com/bfabiszewski/ulogger-android)** is a better fit if you want a lightweight logger with waypoint support (photos and notes attached to locations) and you self-host the matching [uLogger server](https://github.com/bfabiszewski/ulogger-server).
