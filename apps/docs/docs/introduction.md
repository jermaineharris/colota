# Introduction

Colota is a self-hosted GPS tracking app for Android. It sends your location to your own server over HTTP(S), works offline, supports geofencing, and has no analytics or telemetry.

## Key Features

- **Self-Hosted** - Send location data to your own server. Works with Dawarich, GeoPulse, Home Assistant, OwnTracks, Overland, PhoneTrack, Reitti, Traccar or any custom backend.
- **Privacy First** - No analytics, no telemetry, no third-party SDKs. Open source (AGPL-3.0).
- **Works Offline** - Fully functional without a server. Export as CSV, GeoJSON, GPX, or KML.
- **Offline Maps** - Download map areas to your device for use without an internet connection.
- **Scheduled Export** - Automatic daily, weekly or monthly exports to a local directory with file retention management.
- **Encrypted Backup** - Single password-encrypted archive of locations, settings, geofences and credentials.
- **Location History** - View daily summaries, trip segmentation with manual merge and split, calendar with activity dots, per-trip export and per-point notes or deletion.
- **Import Your History** - Bring in existing tracks from GeoJSON, Google Timeline, GPX, KML or CSV.
- **Reliable Tracking** - Foreground service, auto-start on boot and exponential backoff retry.
- **Geofencing** - Pause zones that stop recording locations. Optionally stop GPS entirely when on WiFi or when the device is motionless.
- **Tracking Profiles** - Automatically adjust GPS interval, distance filter and sync settings based on conditions like charging, Android Auto, speed or stationary detection.
- **Flexible Sync** - Instant, batch, Wi-Fi only or offline modes.
- **Display Settings** - Choose between metric and imperial units, 12h or 24h time format. Auto-detected from device locale on first use.
- **App Shortcuts** - Long-press the app icon to start or stop tracking from the home screen. Compatible with automation apps like Tasker and Samsung Routines.
- **Quick Setup** - Configure devices via `huttstracking://setup` deep links or QR codes.
- **Authentication** - Basic Auth, Bearer Token or custom headers. Optional mutual TLS (mTLS) with a PKCS12 client certificate stored in Android Keystore.
- **Dark Mode** - Full light and dark theme support.

| **Offline Maps** | Download map areas to the device for use without an internet connection |
| **Tracking Profiles** | Create and manage condition-based profiles that automatically adjust tracking settings |
| **Profile Editor** | Configure profile name, condition trigger, GPS interval, distance filter, sync interval, priority, and deactivation delay |
| **Location History** | Browse recorded locations on a track map with calendar day picker and trip-colored segments, view segmented trips with per-trip stats; tap a point to add a note or delete it |
| **Trip Detail** | Full trip view with dedicated map, stats grid (distance, duration, avg speed, elevation), speed and elevation profile charts, export, and delete |
| **Location Summary** | Aggregated stats (total distance, trips, active days, avg distance) for selectable periods with daily breakdown and tap-to-inspect navigation |
| **Export Locations** | Export tracked locations as CSV, GeoJSON, GPX, or KML |
| **Import Locations** | Import tracks from GeoJSON, Google Timeline, GPX, KML or CSV with a preview before committing |
| **Auto-Export** | Configure scheduled exports: directory, format, frequency, time of day (with weekday or day-of-month for weekly/monthly), export range and file retention |
| **Data Management** | Clear sent history, delete old data, vacuum the database |
| **Backup & Restore** | Create or restore a single password-encrypted `.colota` archive of all data (locations, settings, geofences, credentials) |
| **Setup Import** | Confirmation screen for deep link configuration imports (`huttstracking://setup`) |
| **Share Setup** | Build a `huttstracking://setup` link or QR code from selected settings to configure another device |
| **Logging** | In-app activity log viewer (level filtering, search, export) plus opt-in persistent file logging |

## Architecture

Colota is a monorepo with a React Native UI layer and native Kotlin modules for background tracking:

- **apps/mobile** - React Native + Kotlin Android app
- **apps/docs** - This documentation site (Docusaurus)
- **packages/shared** - Shared theme colors, typography, and types

The native layer handles the foreground service, database, HTTP sync, geofencing, and credential storage. See the [Architecture](/docs/development/architecture) page for details.
