# API Templates

Colota includes built-in templates for popular backends. Select a template in **Settings > API Settings** to auto-configure field mappings and custom fields.

| Template | HTTP Method | Bearing Field | Custom Fields | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Dawarich** | POST | `cog` | `_type: "location"` | OwnTracks single-point format. Optional Batch chip switches to Overland envelope (see [Dawarich integration](./dawarich.md)). |
| **GeoPulse** | POST | `bear` | _(none)_ | Native Hutts Tracking format |
| **Overland** | POST | n/a (uses Overland format) | `device_id: "colota"` | Batch-only Overland GeoJSON envelope. For any backend that accepts the Overland format (Compass, Wayfinder, Dawarich, etc). |
| **OwnTracks** | POST | `cog` | `_type: "location"`, `tid: "AA"` | Standard OwnTracks HTTP format |
| **PhoneTrack** | POST | `bearing` | `useragent: "Hutts Tracking"` | Nextcloud PhoneTrack format |
| **Reitti** | POST | `bear` | `_type: "location"` | Standard field names |
| **Traccar** | GET or POST | `bearing` | `id: "colota"` | GET: OsmAnd query params, POST: Traccar JSON |
| **Custom** | POST | `bear` | _(none)_ | Fully user-defined |

All templates share the same base fields (`lat`, `lon`, `acc`, `alt`, `vel`, `batt`, `bs`, `tst`) with different field names. Key differences are the HTTP method, bearing field name, and auto-included custom fields.

When you select a template, field mapping, custom fields, and HTTP method are automatically configured. You can still customize individual fields or switch the HTTP method after applying a template.
