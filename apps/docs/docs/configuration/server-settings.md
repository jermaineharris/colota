# Server Settings

| Setting       | Description                            | Default         | Range       |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Endpoint      | HTTP(S) URL of your server             | Empty (offline) | --          |
| HTTP Method   | POST (JSON body) or GET (query params) | POST            | POST / GET  |
| Sync Interval | Batch mode interval                    | Instant (0)     | 0s - Custom |
| Offline Mode  | Disable all network activity           | Disabled        | On/Off      |

## Endpoint URL

Your server endpoint must accept HTTP or HTTPS requests (POST or GET depending on your HTTP Method setting). HTTPS is required for public endpoints. HTTP is restricted to private/local addresses at the network level - public HTTP endpoints will be blocked at request time.

Self-signed and private-CA certificates are supported via three trust paths (system CAs, user-installed device CAs, or an in-app imported CA). Servers that require client-certificate authentication (mTLS) are also supported. See the [mTLS guide](./mtls) for setup.

On **Android 17+**, connecting to another device on the local network (everything above except `localhost`) requires the **ACCESS_LOCAL_NETWORK** permission. Hutts Tracking requests this when you use **Test Connection**. See [Permissions](/docs/development/permissions#local-network-access) for details.

Use the **Test Connection** button in Settings → Connection to verify your server is reachable.

### Multiple Backends

Colota sends to a single endpoint. To forward locations to multiple services simultaneously (e.g. Dawarich + Home Assistant), use [colota-forwarder](https://github.com/dietrichmax/colota-forwarder) - point Hutts Tracking at the forwarder and configure each target in the forwarder's environment variables.

### URL Variables

You can use template variables in your endpoint URL for hive-style partitioning or date-based routing. Variables are resolved per location using the location's timestamp, not the current wall clock time, so queued or delayed sends use the correct date.

| Variable     | Description              | Example      |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| `%DATE`      | ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)    | `2026-04-07` |
| `%YEAR`      | Four-digit year          | `2026`       |
| `%MONTH`     | Zero-padded month        | `04`         |
| `%DAY`       | Zero-padded day          | `07`         |
| `%TIMESTAMP` | Unix timestamp (seconds) | `1775692800` |

**Example:** `https://example.com/locations/%YEAR/%MONTH/%DAY` resolves to `https://example.com/locations/2026/04/07`.

This is useful for backends that organize data by date (e.g. S3 with hive partitioning).

## Sync Modes

- **Instant (0s)**: Each location is sent immediately after recording
- **Batch (1 min, 5 min, 15 min, or Custom)**: Locations are queued and sent in batches at the configured interval
- **Offline**: No network activity - data is stored locally only. See [Offline Mode](#offline-mode) below.

## Offline Mode

Enable **Offline Mode** in Settings to use Hutts Tracking as a standalone tracker without any server. Locations are recorded and stored locally on-device.

### Enabling Offline Mode

When you toggle offline mode on with unsent locations still in the queue, a dialog offers several options:

- **Sync First** - attempt to upload queued locations before switching (only available if an endpoint is configured)
- **Keep in Queue** - preserve queued locations for later sync when you disable offline mode
- **Cancel** - abort and stay in online mode

If no locations are queued, offline mode enables immediately.

### What Changes in Offline Mode

The UI simplifies to remove sync-related elements that don't apply:

**Hidden in offline mode:**

- Server Endpoint and Test Connection
- Authentication & Headers
- API Field Mapping
- Sync Interval, Sync Condition (Any / Wi-Fi / SSID / VPN)
- Queue statistics (Queued / Sent counts)
- Queue actions (Sync Now, Clear Sent History, Clear Queue)
- Queue info in the tracking notification

**Still available in offline mode:**

- All tracking parameters (interval, movement threshold, accuracy)
- Tracking profiles and geofences
- Data export (CSV, GeoJSON, GPX, KML) - both manual and auto-export
- Database statistics (Total locations, Today count, Storage)
- Data cleanup (Delete All Locations, Delete Old, Optimize Database)

### Disabling Offline Mode

Toggle offline mode off in Settings to return to online mode. If you had an endpoint configured before, syncing resumes with your previous settings. Any locations that were kept in the queue will be sent on the next sync cycle.

## Retry Behavior

A location counts as delivered only when your server responds with a `2xx` status - any other status or a network error is treated as a failure and retried. For custom endpoints, make sure your script or webhook returns `2xx` on success.

When sync attempts fail, Hutts Tracking uses exponential backoff:

```
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: +30s delay
Attempt 3: +60s delay (1 minute)
Attempt 4: +300s delay (5 minutes)
Attempt 5+: +900s delay (15 minutes)
```

Failed uploads stay in the queue and are retried indefinitely until they succeed. No data is ever dropped due to failed sync attempts. You can clear the queue manually in Settings > Data Management if needed.

The app also auto-syncs when network connectivity is restored.
